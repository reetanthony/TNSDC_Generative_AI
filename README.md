# TNSDC_Generative_AI
# Overview
This project aims to develop an AI-driven sentence auto-completion system using generative AI techniques. The system predicts and generates contextually relevant text continuations based on user input, providing assistance in creative writing, content generation, and language exploration tasks.
# Features
AI Sentence Auto-Completion: Predicts and generates text continuations based on user input.
Generative AI Techniques: Utilizes advanced machine learning models, such as LSTM networks, for language generation.
User-Friendly Interface: Provides a user-friendly interface with intuitive features for seamless interaction.
Customization Options: Allows users to customize input parameters and adjust model settings.
Training and Evaluation: Includes scripts for model training, evaluation, and performance analysis.
# Dataset:
The dataset used for building the model has been obtained from Kaggle. This is a dataset comprised of all of Shakespeare's plays in the form of a csv file. We can easily use this data to generate embeddings and subsequently train an LSTM model.
# Steps to Use the generator
Download the Ipython Notebook File (.ipynb) and the dataset from the repository.
Open it in Jupyter Notebook or in Google Colab - Use GPU enabled execution for faster and efficient training of the model.
Once trained, Give input prompts to the system and the output will be generated which is relevent and coherent to the input.
Explore different prompts and settings to experiment with various sentences.
